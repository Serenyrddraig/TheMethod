# TheMethod

This file extends [Enterprise Architect](http://www.sparxsystems.com) (EA)
 to enable the use of the [IDesign Method<sup>(TM)</sup>](http://www.idesign.net)
 for designing microservices. The extensions include profiles for stereotypes,
 diagram specializations, and toolbars that span both "TheMethod" and some
 aspects of Microsoft<sup>(R)</sup> Windows Communications Foundation (WCF).
 
 There are a variety of ways to install this file into EA, either on a 
 [per model](http://sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/13.0/modeling_tools/importmdgtechnologies.html)
 basis or as part of the [tool infrastructure](http://sparxsystems.com/enterprise_architect_user_guide/13.0/modeling_tools/deploying_mdg_technologies.html).
